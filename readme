# Terraform Module for Cloud Function and Cloud Scheduler with Pub/Sub Integration to automate the sqlbackups

This module automates the deployment of a Google Cloud Function that is triggered by a Pub/Sub topic. It also sets up a Cloud Scheduler job to publish messages to the Pub/Sub topic. The module ensures the required supporting resources, such as storage buckets and Pub/Sub topics, are created and configured.

---

## Features

- Creates a **Pub/Sub Topic** for triggering the Cloud Function.
- Provisions a **Cloud Storage Bucket** to store the Cloud Function source code.
- Deploys a **Cloud Function** with customizable runtime, memory, and entry point.
- Configures the Cloud Function with an **event trigger** based on Pub/Sub.
- Sets up a **Cloud Scheduler Job** to publish messages to the Pub/Sub topic on a defined schedule.
